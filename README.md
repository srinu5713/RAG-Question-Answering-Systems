# RAG Question Answering Systems

This repository contains implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question answering systems using two different approaches: OpenAI's GPT and Llama Index. These systems integrate retrieval mechanisms with generative models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Approach and Importance

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. The retrieval component fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, which are then used by the generative model to produce more informed and accurate responses. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle a wide range of queries by leveraging external knowledge sources.

### OpenAI GPT-based RAG
This implementation uses OpenAI's GPT model for the generative component, combined with a custom retrieval system. The notebook demonstrates how to integrate the GPT model with a retrieval mechanism to enhance its answering capabilities.

### Llama Index-based RAG
This implementation uses the Llama Index for retrieval, paired with a generative model. The notebook shows how to use the Llama Index to retrieve relevant information, which is then utilized by the generative model to provide answers.


## Usage

1. **OpenAI GPT-based RAG**:
   - Open the `RAG_OpenAI.ipynb` notebook.
   - Follow the instructions to set up the environment and run the cells.
   - The notebook includes steps to load the knowledge base, perform retrieval, and generate answers using the OpenAI GPT model.

2. **Llama Index-based RAG**:
   - Open the `RAG_Llama2_with_llamaindex.ipynb` notebook.
   - Follow the instructions to set up the environment and run the cells.
   - The notebook includes steps to load the knowledge base, perform retrieval using Llama Index, and generate answers with the generative model.

## Importance of RAG Systems

RAG systems represent a significant advancement in the field of question answering by combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. They are particularly useful in scenarios where:
- The knowledge required to answer questions is vast and cannot be entirely encoded in the model's parameters.
- The accuracy and relevance of answers need to be improved by leveraging external information.
- The system needs to provide answers based on the most up-to-date information available in the knowledge base.

By exploring different implementations of RAG systems, this repository aims to provide insights into how retrieval mechanisms can enhance the performance of generative models in question answering tasks.
